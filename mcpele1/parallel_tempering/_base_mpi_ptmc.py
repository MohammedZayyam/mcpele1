class _MPI_Parallel_Tempering(with_metaclass(abc.ABCMeta, object)):
    """Abstract class for MPI Parallel Tempering calculations

    :class:`_MPI_Parallel_Tempering` implements all the basic MPI routines. The initialisation
    function and the method to find the swap pattern need to implemented in a specific child method.

    The replica exchange method (REM) or parallel tempering (PT) is a Monte Carlo scheme that targets
    the slow equilibration of systems characterised by large barriers in their free energy landscape.
    In REM :math:`n` replicas of the system are simulated simultaneously in the canonical (NVT) ensemble.
    These systems differ in temperature and, while the high temperature replicas explore the high energy
    regions of phase space, easily crossing large free energy barriers, the low temperature replicas
    explore the low lying regions of the energy landscape. In the hierarchical picture of the energy landscape,
    in which intra-funnel equilibration is fast and inter-funnel is slow, the high temperature replicas explore the
    energy landscape hopping between funnels, while the low temperature replicas explore individual funnels
    accurately. The idea of REM is to introduce moves that swap configurations between the different replicas,
    thus making the high energy regions available to the low temperature simulations and *vice versa*. It
    is not hard to see why this makes the exploration of configurational space more efficient, thus accelerating
    equilibration.

    The acceptance rule for parallel tempering is

    .. math:: P( x_i \Rightarrow x_j) = min \{ 1, \exp [- (\\beta_j - \\beta_i) (E_i - E_j)] \}

    The choice of temperature scale is very important for efficient equilibration to occur. From the acceptance rule
    we see that the acceptance will be suppressed exponentially by large differences in energy between the two
    configurations, just as for the Metropolis algorithm, but also by large differences in temperature. Thus, we
    must keep this product of differences as small as possible, to allow for efficient swapping. As a rule of thumb this
    can be achieved by using a scale of geometrically increasing temperatures.

    It is important to note that REM is a truly equilibrium Monte Carlo method: the microscopic equilibrium of each ensemble
    is not disturbed by the swaps, hence the ensemble averages for each replica are just as valid as for ordinary Monte Carlo
    simulations (unlike simulated annealing, for which ensemble averages are not well defined). In addition, ensemble averages
    for the extended ensemble can be obtained by histogram reweighting technique. We also highlight the fact that REM moves are
    very cheap to perform since they do not require additional energy evaluations.

    .. note :: An optimal Parallel Tempering strategy should make sure that all MCMC walks take roughly the same amount of time.
               Besides this fundamental consideration, note that root (rank=0) is not an evil master but rather an enlightened
               dictator that leads by example: root is responsible to assign jobs and control parameters (e.g. temperature) to
               the slaves but it also performs MCMC walks along with them. For this reason it might be optimal to give root a
               set of control parameters for which the simulation is leaner so that it can start doing its own things while the
               slaves finish their work.
